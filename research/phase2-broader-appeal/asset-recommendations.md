---

## Specific Asset Recommendations

### 1. ICON SYSTEM (Principle Representations)

**Current State:**
Each principle has an icon identifier (brain-circuit, nested-circles, waveform, etc.)

**Recommended Approach:**
Create a cohesive icon system using sacred geometry as foundation.

**Design Specs:**

**Style:**
- Line-based geometric icons
- 2-3px stroke weight
- Symmetrical (sacred geometry principles)
- Scalable (work at 24px and 240px)

**Principle Icon Concepts:**

**1. Mentalism (Current: brain-circuit)**
- **Geometric form:** Concentric circles radiating from center (consciousness expanding)
- **Sacred geometry:** Sri Yantra-inspired, simplified
- **Color:** Purple (#8B5CF6)
- **Animation:** Pulse gently from center outward

**2. Correspondence (Current: nested-circles)**
- **Geometric form:** Fractal pattern (As above, so below)
- **Sacred geometry:** Nested triangles (macrocosm/microcosm)
- **Color:** Cyan (#06B6D4)

---

### 2. ILLUSTRATION STYLE

**Recommended Style: "Geometric Organic Fusion"**

**Characteristics:**
- Base forms geometric (circles, triangles, spirals)
- Softened edges (not harsh/rigid)
- Gradient fills (depth without shading complexity)
- Flat design with depth (subtle shadows, layering)
- Cosmic elements (stars, nebulas, light rays)

**Color Approach:**
- Dark backgrounds (#0F0F1A - cosmic black)
- Principle colors as accents (current palette)
- Gradients between related principles
- Glow effects (neon highlights on dark)

**When to Use Illustrations:**

**Homepage Hero:**
- Large illustration showing all 7 principles as interconnected system
- Sacred geometry forming constellation
- Each principle icon glowing in its color

**Principle Pages:**
- Hero illustration per principle (visual metaphor)
- Example: Mentalism = brain formed from cosmic nebula
- Example: Correspondence = fractal patterns zooming infinitely

**Interactive Experiences:**
- Visualizations for each principle's experience
- Example: Vibration = frequency visualizer with sound waves
- Example: Polarity = perspective flip (light/dark, yin/yang)

**Achievement Badges:**
- Small illustrated icons for milestones
- Principle color + geometric symbol
- Unlock animations (fade in, glow, celebrate)

**Loading States:**
- Animated principle icons
- Geometric patterns forming/dissolving

---

### 3. PHOTOGRAPHY

**Usage:** Minimal, strategic, always supporting - never primary

**When to Use Photography:**

**Never:**
- Don't use stock photos of "teens studying" (cringe)
- Don't use generic "person meditating" images
- Don't use anything that feels corporate/fake

**Acceptable Use Cases:**
- Nature fractals (ferns, coastlines, crystals) - for Correspondence
- Athletic action (but stylized, high-contrast) - for Rhythm, Cause-Effect
- Abstract textures (fire, water, clouds) - as background layers
- Art process photos (hands creating) - for creative content

**Treatment:**
- Always heavily stylized (not realistic)
- Duotone with principle colors
- High contrast, deep shadows
- Blurred as background layer (focus on UI)

**Better Alternative:**
- Use illustrations instead of photos 90% of the time
- If photo needed, commission custom or use Unsplash with heavy editing
