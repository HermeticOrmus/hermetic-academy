# Hermetic Content Landscape Analysis

**Research Date:** 2025-11-10 (Phase 2)
**Purpose:** Map existing Hermetic content (YouTube, books, courses) to identify gaps and opportunities
**Focus:** What exists, what's missing, and how Hermetic Academy fills the void

---

## Executive Summary

**Market Reality:** Hermetic content exists BUT:
1. **Adult-focused** (almost no youth-specific content)
2. **Lecture-heavy** (not interactive or gamified)
3. **Spiritually-coded** (alienates skeptical/intellectual youth)
4. **No structured system** (scattered teachings, no progression)
5. **Zero community** (passive consumption, no belonging)

**Opportunity:** We're creating a new category - **"Youth-First Interactive Hermetic Education"**

**Why This Works:**
