### Background
Tyler's been playing League of Legends competitively for 3 years. Currently Platinum 2, dreams of hitting Diamond. Spends 3-4 hours daily gaming, watches pro streams, studies VODs. Understands concepts like "mental game," "tilt," "macro vs micro," and "skill expression."

### Pain Points
- Tilts easily, loses games to mental mistakes
