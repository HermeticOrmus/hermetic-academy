# Communication Playbook: Tone, Language, and Visual Guidelines

**Purpose:** Define how Hermetic Academy communicates across all channels
**Audience:** 11-18 year old gaming-fluent youth
**Approach:** Authentic, competent, respectful, never cringe

---

## Core Communication Principles

### 1. **Respect Their Intelligence**
They're not children. They've mastered complex games. Speak to their competence.

**DO:**
- Assume they understand gaming concepts
- Use sophisticated vocabulary when appropriate
- Explain complex principles clearly (not simplistically)

**DON'T:**
- Talk down or condescend
- Over-explain obvious things
- Use "kiddie" language

---

### 2. **Authenticity Over Relatability**
Don't try to be "their friend." Be real, be useful, be trustworthy.

**DO:**
- Admit when something might sound cringe
- Be transparent about our business model
- Show actual gameplay/system (not just marketing)

**DON'T:**
- Force slang to seem relatable
- Pretend to be "just like them"
- Hide commercial intent

---

### 3. **Value First, Always**
Every piece of communication should deliver genuine value.

**DO:**
- Teach something useful
- Provide actionable insights
- Respect their time

**DON'T:**
- Clickbait without delivery
- Waste time with fluff
- Make empty promises

---

### 4. **Self-Aware Humor**
Acknowledge the potential cringe. Own it.

**DO:**
- "I know this sounds like self-help BS, but hear me out..."
- "Yes, we're teaching ancient wisdom through League. Stay with me."
- Meta-commentary when appropriate

**DON'T:**
- Take ourselves too seriously
- Be defensive about criticism
- Use humor to avoid substance

---

## Tone Guidelines by Context

### **Educational Content** (Principle Explanations, Quests)
**Tone:** Clear, insightful, empowering

**Voice:** Knowledgeable guide (not guru)

**Example:**
"Mentalism means your thoughts shape your reality. Not in a 'manifest your dreams' way. In a 'your mental state determines which challenges you can handle' way. Just like in League: tilt = throw game. In life: bad mental = bad outcomes. Master your mental, master your reality."

**Why It Works:**
- Defines clearly
- Distinguishes from cringe self-help
- Uses gaming metaphor
- Practical application

---

### **Community Communication** (Discord, Comments, DMs)
**Tone:** Warm, supportive, peer-level

**Voice:** Helpful community member (not authority figure)

**Example:**
"Congrats on hitting Apprentice! That's solid progress. How are you finding the Rhythm principle quests? They can be tricky at first."

**Why It Works:**
- Celebrates wins
- Asks genuine questions
- Peer-level (not top-down)
- Supportive without being patronizing

---

### **Marketing Content** (TikTok, Instagram, Ads)
**Tone:** Confident, intriguing, valuable

**Voice:** Person sharing something genuinely cool they found

**Example:**
"So I built a self-improvement app that looks like League ranked. You earn LP for IRL leveling up. All the wisdom content is free. Yeah, it sounds weird. Here's why it works..."

**Why It Works:**
- Honest about uniqueness
- Acknowledges potential skepticism
- Clear value prop (free)
- Promises explanation (keeps watching)

---

### **System Messages** (Achievements, Notifications, UI Copy)
**Tone:** Encouraging, game-like, concise

**Voice:** The game itself (like League client)

**Example:**
"Achievement Unlocked: Mental Diff Master
You completed 7 Mentalism quests. Your mental game is leveling up.
+50 LP | +500 XP"

**Why It Works:**
- Gaming language (Mental Diff)
- Specific (7 quests)
- Reward clear
- Brief (respects time)

---

### **Help/Support** (FAQ, Troubleshooting)
**Tone:** Helpful, patient, clear

**Voice:** Competent support person who gets it

**Example:**
"Streak broke and you DID check in yesterday? That sucks. Here's how to report it:
1. Screenshot your login history
2. DM @support on Discord
3. We'll restore it within 24 hours

We know streaks matter. We'll make it right."

**Why It Works:**
- Empathizes (that sucks)
- Clear action steps
- Commits to resolution
- Acknowledges emotional investment

---

## Language Guidelines

### Vocabulary: What to Use

**Gaming Terms** (Use confidently):
- Rank, LP, XP, level, quest, achievement
- Mental, diff, gap, cracked, carried
- Main, grind, climb, meta
- Buff, nerf, cooldown, power spike

**Hermetic Terms** (Explain first time, use freely after):
- Principle, correspondence, polarity, rhythm
- Mentalism, vibration, cause-effect, gender
- Seeker, Apprentice, Adept, Master, Sage, Ascended, Enlightened

**Self-Improvement Terms** (Reclaim from cringe):
- Growth, mastery, transformation, skill development
- Framework, mindset, practice
- AVOID: "Hustle," "grind mindset," "manifestation"

---

### Slang: When to Use

**Rarely and Strategically:**
- Use when genuinely fits
- Only if you'd use it naturally
- Platform-appropriate (Discord vs website)

**Safe Bets:**
- "No cap" (if you mean it)
- "Hits different" (describes unique quality)
- "Main character energy" (confidence)
- "Understood the assignment" (nailed it)

**Avoid:**
- Anything you have to look up
- Anything that feels forced
- Anything outdated (you'll miss timing)

**Better Approach:**
Just use standard English competently. They respect good communication over forced slang.

---

### Emojis: Minimal and Purposeful

**When to Use:**
- Achievement notifications (🔥 for streak, ⚡ for level up)
- Celebration moments (✨ for badge unlock)
- Discord reactions (community-appropriate)

**When NOT to Use:**
- Educational content (distracting)
- Serious topics (minimizing)
- Every sentence (over-eager)

**Rule:** 1-2 emojis max per message, only when they add meaning

## The "Read-Aloud Test"

**Before publishing any copy:**

1. Read it out loud
2. Ask: "Would I actually say this in a Discord voice chat?"
3. If NO → Rewrite to be more natural
4. If YES → Check: Does it deliver value?
5. If YES to both → Publish

**This test catches:**
- Forced formality
- Unnatural phrasing
- Cringe "fellow kids" energy
- Corporate-speak

---

## A/B Testing Priorities

### Test These Hypotheses:

**Tone:**
- Casual vs Professional (hypothesis: casual wins)
- Self-aware cringe acknowledgment vs confident (hypothesis: self-aware wins)
- Gaming metaphors vs direct explanation (hypothesis: metaphors win)

**CTAs:**
- "Try it free" vs "Start at Seeker I" (hypothesis: gaming CTA wins)
- "Link in bio" vs specific promise (hypothesis: specific wins)
- Emoji vs no emoji (hypothesis: 1 emoji wins)

**Format:**
- Short-form only vs short + long-form (hypothesis: both wins)
- Memes vs straight education (hypothesis: 80/20 education/memes)
- Voice over vs text only (hypothesis: VO wins on YouTube, text wins on TikTok)

### Qualitative Signals
