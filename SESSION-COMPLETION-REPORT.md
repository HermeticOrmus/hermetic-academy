Users don't just read about principles. They:
- Build mind maps and see thought cascades
- Zoom through 9 scales of reality
- Visualize sound frequencies
- Flip perspectives on real scenarios
- Track natural cycles
- Choose actions and see consequences
- Balance masculine/feminine energies

### 3. **Respectful = Effective**
No condescension. No preaching. Just:
- "This is how it works in ranked. Same IRL."
- Clear parallels between games and life
- Self-aware humor
- Practical wisdom
