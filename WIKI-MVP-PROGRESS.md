# Hermetic Wiki - MVP Progress Report

**Date**: 2025-11-10
**Session**: Wiki Foundation Build
**Status**: 📝 Content Creation In Progress

---

## 🎯 Strategic Approach

### The Wiki-First Philosophy

**Decision**: Build comprehensive knowledge base BEFORE complex interactive features

**Why**:
- ✅ **Fast Validation** - Know if people want this in days, not months
- ✅ **Low Risk** - If concept fails, we learn quickly with minimal investment
- ✅ **High Value** - Users get wisdom immediately, not "coming soon"
- ✅ **SEO Foundation** - Content attracts organic traffic from day 1
- ✅ **Iterative** - Easy to add/improve articles based on feedback

**The Validation Question**: "Do teens want Hermetic wisdom in gaming language?"

**Wiki answers this BEFORE building expensive interactive experiences.**
