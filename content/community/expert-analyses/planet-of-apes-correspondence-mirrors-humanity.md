## What I'm Analyzing

"Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes" (2024) - the latest film showing apes building civilization while humanity regresses - as a perfect demonstration of the Hermetic Principle of Correspondence: "As above, so below."

---

## The Hermetic Principles at Work

### Primary: **Correspondence** - "As above, so below; as below, so above"

The film's central premise **IS** Correspondence:
- **Apes rising** mirrors **humans falling**
- **Their civilization building** reflects **our civilization collapsing**
- **Microcosm** (individual ape society) mirrors **macrocosm** (human history)
- **External conflict** (ape vs human) reflects **internal conflict** (beast vs divine within)

### Secondary: **Polarity** - Integration of opposites

- Human ↔ Animal (same spectrum, different points)
- Civilization ↔ Barbarism (opposites are identical, varying by degree)
- Intelligence ↔ Instinct (both required for survival)
- Evolution ↔ Devolution (simultaneous movement on same pole)

### Tertiary: **Mentalism** - Mind creates reality

- Apes' **belief in their evolution** enables their evolution
- Humans' **loss of belief in their civilization** causes civilization's collapse
- **What you think collectively** becomes **what you are collectively**

## The Analysis

### How Correspondence Shows Up in the Film

**The Central Mirror**:

**AS APES RISE** (learning language, building culture, creating laws):
- **↕️ HUMANS FALL** (losing language, abandoning culture, descending to survival)

**This isn't coincidence. This is Correspondence in action.**

When one end of a spectrum rises, the other end falls. When new consciousness emerges (apes), old consciousness must transform or decline (humans).

### The Four Levels of Correspondence

**1. PHYSICAL LEVEL** (Literal plot)
- Apes physically evolving into intelligent beings
- Humans physically regressing from virus
- Planet shifting from human-dominated to ape-dominated

**2. PSYCHOLOGICAL LEVEL** (Character mirrors)
- **Noa (ape protagonist)** mirrors **Caesar (previous ape leader)**
- **Human survivor Mae** mirrors **apes in original films** (oppressed, desperate)
- Each character contains both beast and divine

**3. SOCIETAL LEVEL** (Civilization patterns)
- **Ape clans forming** = Early human tribal development
- **Apes discovering old human tech** = Humans discovering fire/tools
- **Ape conflict over resources** = Human wars throughout history
- **Same patterns, different species** = Correspondence

**4. ARCHETYPAL LEVEL** (Universal patterns)
- Rise and fall of empires (human → ape)
- Hubris of intelligence (humans thought themselves supreme)
- Cyclical nature of dominance (power always shifts)
- Evolution never stops (consciousness finds new vessels)

### The Hermetic Lesson: Patterns Repeat

**What makes this Hermetically profound**:

The film shows that **patterns of civilization repeat regardless of species**:

- **Apes aren't "better" than humans**
- **They're repeating the same patterns**
- **Because the patterns are archetypal, not species-specific**

**Evidence in film**:
- Apes forming hierarchies (like humans did)
- Apes going to war over ideology (like humans do)
- Apes exploiting lower-intelligence beings (like humans did to them)
- Apes worshipping symbols/myths (like humans always have)

**Correspondence teaches**: Change the characters, but patterns remain. Because patterns exist at higher level than physical manifestation.

## The Insight: We Are Watching Ourselves

**The uncomfortable truth the film reveals**:

**When you watch apes becoming "civilized,"** you're not watching them.
**You're watching humanity's reflection.**

**When you watch humans regressing to "animals,"** you're not watching regression.
**You're watching what we've always been beneath the veneer.**

### The Mirror Shows Three Truths

**TRUTH 1: The Gap Between Species Is Smaller Than We Think**

- Apes + enhanced intelligence = Human-like behavior
- Humans - technology/language = Animal-like behavior
- **The difference**: Not fundamental nature, just **degree of consciousness**

**Polarity Principle**: Human and animal aren't opposites—they're **poles of same spectrum**. Move consciousness up or down the spectrum, behavior shifts accordingly.

**TRUTH 2: Civilization Patterns Are Universal**

Whether ape or human, **same patterns emerge**:
- Tribal formation
- Resource competition
- Ideological conflict
- Technology development
- Power hierarchies
- War and conquest

**Correspondence Principle**: Patterns at micro level (individual ape society) mirror patterns at macro level (all consciousness evolution).

**TRUTH 3: Nothing is Permanent**

- Human dominance wasn't eternal
- Ape rise won't be eternal either
- **All kingdoms fall**
- **New kingdoms emerge**
- **The cycle continues**

**Rhythm Principle**: What rises must fall. What falls can rise. The pendulum swings forever.

## Real-World Application

### What You Can Learn from This Mirror

**1. Recognize Yourself in "Others"**

**The film forces this question**: If apes can become like us, what does that say about us?

**Applied to your life**:
- That person you judge as "less than" → Contains your same patterns
- That group you see as "different" → Mirrors your same struggles
- That behavior you condemn in others → Exists in you at different degree

**Correspondence teaches**: What you see "out there" exists "in here." The external world mirrors internal reality.

**Practice**:
- When you judge apes in film as "barbaric" → Recognize human barbarism
- When you judge humans in film as "fallen" → Recognize your own falls
- **The mirror works both ways**

**2. Understand Patterns, Not Just Events**

**Don't watch film as**: "Apes taking over planet"
**Watch film as**: "Universal patterns of rise and fall manifesting through different forms"

**Applied to your life**:
- Your current struggle → Not unique, it's archetypal pattern
- Your relationship dynamic → Not personal, it's universal pattern
- Your career challenge → Not isolated, it's repeating pattern

**Once you recognize the pattern**, you can work with it instead of being victim to it.

**3. The Pole Shift: Apes Rising = Humans Falling**

**Correspondence shows**: Movement on one end creates movement on other end.

**Applied to your life**:
- You rising in career → Someone else's position shifts
- You claiming your power → Others' power relationship to you changes
- You healing your wounds → Family dynamics must reorganize

**This isn't cruel. This is physics of consciousness.**

When you shift your position on spectrum, everything in relationship to you shifts too.

**4. Nothing is Permanent**

**The film's deepest teaching**:

Humans ruled for thousands of years. **Then didn't.**
Apes were subjugated for thousands of years. **Then weren't.**

**What seems permanent never is.**

**Applied to your life**:
- Current pain → Will shift
- Current power → Will evolve
- Current identity → Will transform
- Current certainty → Will be questioned

**This can be terrifying or liberating**, depending on what you're clinging to.

## Questions for Reflection

1. **What "others" in my life mirror aspects of myself I haven't integrated?** (Who am I judging? What does that judgment reveal about me?)

2. **What patterns am I repeating that I think are unique to me?** (Are my struggles archetypal patterns many have faced?)

3. **Where am I rising in one area while something else falls?** (What's the correspondence between my gains and losses?)

4. **What do I believe is permanent that actually isn't?** (What am I clinging to that the rhythm wants to shift?)

5. **Can I see humanity in the "inhuman" and beast in the "civilized"?** (Can I hold both poles simultaneously?)

---

## The Hermetic Truth

**The film isn't science fiction about apes.**
**It's a mirror showing you humanity.**

**And humanity isn't separate from the beasts.**
**We're on the same spectrum, just different point.**

### The Three Levels of Watching This Film

**LEVEL 1** (Entertainment): "Cool movie about smart apes"

**LEVEL 2** (Social Commentary): "Critique of human hubris and environmental destruction"

**LEVEL 3** (Hermetic Wisdom): "Demonstration of Correspondence - all patterns repeat, all poles shift, all consciousness evolves"

### The Practice

**Next time you watch the film** (or any film showing human/other dynamics):

1. **Identify the mirror**
   - What aspect of humanity do the apes reflect?
   - What aspect of animality do the humans reflect?
   - Where do the poles meet?

2. **Find the pattern**
   - What universal pattern is being shown?
   - Where have you seen this pattern before?
   - Where does this pattern exist in your life?

3. **Locate the correspondence**
   - Inner/outer mirror
   - Micro/macro mirror
   - Self/other mirror
   - Rise/fall mirror

4. **Integrate the teaching**
   - What is this mirror showing you about yourself?
   - What pattern in your life mirrors this pattern in the film?
   - What transformation is being offered?

## The Final Mirror

**The film's ending** (no spoilers): Sets up future films showing ape civilization's continued evolution.

**The Hermetic prophecy**: Apes will eventually face the same challenges humans faced. They'll make the same mistakes. They'll experience the same rise and fall.

**Because patterns are eternal.**
**Forms change. Patterns remain.**

**You watching apes repeat human patterns** = **Universe watching you repeat universal patterns**.

**The question isn't**: "Will apes avoid human mistakes?"

**The question is**: "Will YOU break YOUR patterns, or repeat them forever?"

**As above, so below.**
**As in film, so in life.**
**As in apes, so in you.**

**The mirror reflects endlessly.**

*The apes aren't the aliens in this film. The apes are us. Always have been. The question is: Can we see ourselves in the mirror?*
