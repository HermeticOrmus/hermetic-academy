# Cause-Effect: Your Plays Create Your LP

> **TL;DR**: Nothing happens by chance. Every outcome is the result of specific causes. Your rank isn't luck - it's accumulated consequences of thousands of micro-decisions. Control the causes, control the effects.

---

## The Core Teaching

**Ancient Phrasing**: "Every Cause has its Effect; every Effect has its Cause; everything happens according to Law; Chance is but a name for Law not recognized."

**What This Means**: The universe operates on cause and effect, not randomness. What looks like luck or chance is just causes you didn't recognize. Everything that happens was caused by something. Change the causes, change what happens.

## Why This Matters (Gaming Edition)

### Your LP is Not Random

You know that feeling when you're "hardstuck" in a rank and blame:
- Bad teammates
- Unlucky matchmaking
- Smurfs on enemy team
- Server lag
- Meta champions

**Here's the Hermetic truth**: Your rank is the EFFECT of specific CAUSES you're creating every game.

Not because you're "bad." Because **you're creating causes unconsciously instead of deliberately.**

### The 10,000 Micro-Decisions

Every ranked game, you make ~10,000 decisions:
- Where to ward
- When to trade
- Which ability to use
- When to back
- How to respond to pings
- Whether to tilt or reset mental

**Each decision is a CAUSE that creates an EFFECT.**

Most players make 10,000 unconscious decisions → Random results → "Why am I stuck?"

High elo players make 10,000 conscious decisions → Predictable results → Consistent climb

**Same game. Different awareness of cause-effect chains.**

## How It Works

### The Cause-Effect Chain

Every cause creates an effect, which becomes a cause for the next effect, creating a chain:

**Example: The Mute Chain**

**Cause 1**: Toxic teammate flaming in chat
- **Effect 1**: You get distracted/tilted

**Cause 2**: You respond and argue
- **Effect 2**: More tilt, team coordination drops

**Cause 3**: You play worse due to mental state
- **Effect 3**: More mistakes, team blames you more

**Cause 4**: You queue tilted for next game
- **Effect 4**: You play below your skill level

**Final Effect**: Lose 2-3 winnable games, -50 LP

**Alternative Chain:**

**Cause 1**: Toxic teammate flaming
- **Effect 1**: You mute immediately

**Cause 2**: You stay focused on YOUR gameplay
- **Effect 2**: You make better decisions

**Cause 3**: Your good plays inspire team
- **Effect 3**: Team rallies, coordinates better

**Final Effect**: Win 1-2 of those games, +30 LP

**Same initial situation. Different first cause (mute vs engage). Completely different final effect.**

Over 100 games, that's 10-20 extra wins from ONE consistent cause.

### Short-Term vs Long-Term Effects

Some causes have immediate effects. Some take time to compound.

**Immediate:**
- Flash badly (cause) → Die (effect)
- Ward bush (cause) → See gank (effect)
- Mute toxic player (cause) → Less tilt (effect)

**Compounding:**
- Practice CSing 10 min/day (cause) → 10% better CS after 2 weeks (effect) → 200 extra gold per game (effect) → Better items (effect) → More kills (effect) → Higher win rate (effect)

**The trap**: Most people only notice immediate effects. They miss the compounding effects that actually determine their rank.

## The Three Types of Causes

### Type 1: Mechanical Causes
**What**: Physical actions in game
**Examples**:
- Skillshot accuracy
- CS timing
- Combo execution

**Effect**: Immediate gameplay results

### Type 2: Mental Causes
**What**: Your thoughts and emotional state
**Examples**:
- Going in tilted
- Playing scared vs confident
- Fixed mindset vs growth mindset

**Effect**: Determines which mechanical plays you even attempt

### Type 3: Strategic Causes
**What**: Your decision-making and planning
**Examples**:
- Champion pool choices
- When you queue (fresh vs tired)
- Whether you watch VODs

**Effect**: Determines your rate of improvement over time

**Most players focus only on Type 1. High elo players master all three.**

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake #1: "It's Just Bad Luck"

**Wrong thinking**: "I lost 5 in a row, just unlucky teammates"

**Cause-Effect truth**: Break down what YOU contributed:
- Did you mute flamers? (Cause)
- Did you queue tilted after loss 1? (Cause)
- Did you play your best champion or try something new? (Cause)
- Did you communicate with team? (Cause)

**You can't control teammates. But your response to them is a CAUSE you control.**

### Mistake #2: "Small Things Don't Matter"

**Wrong thinking**: "Whether I ward this bush doesn't really change anything"

**Cause-Effect truth**:
- Ward bush (cause) → See gank (effect) → Survive (effect) → Get 3 waves of XP (effect) → Hit level 6 first (effect) → Win all-in (effect) → Get turret plates (effect) → 500 gold advantage (effect) → Earlier item spike (effect) → More kill pressure (effect)

**One ward = 10+ downstream effects over 5 minutes.**

### Mistake #3: "I Can't Change My Rank"

**Wrong thinking**: "I'm just a Gold player, that's my level"

**Cause-Effect truth**: Your rank is an EFFECT, not a fixed identity.
- Current rank = Effect of past causes
- Want different rank? Create different causes.
- **You're not changing WHO YOU ARE. You're changing WHAT YOU DO.**

## Practical Applications

### In Ranked Games

**Before Queue: Set Up Winning Causes**
- Cause: Am I in good mental state?
- Effect: Will determine game quality
- Action: Only queue fresh/focused

**During Game: Create Smart Causes**
- Cause: Mute first sign of toxicity
- Effect: Maintain mental clarity
- Cause: Die → Immediately identify mistake
- Effect: Don't repeat same error

**After Game: Track Cause-Effect Patterns**
- What did I do (cause) that led to wins?
- What did I do (cause) that led to losses?
- **Do more of winning causes, less of losing causes**

### In Life

**Career:**
- Cause: Learn high-value skill
- Effect: More opportunities appear
- Cause: Network with skilled people
- Effect: Higher quality career options

**Relationships:**
- Cause: Listen before responding
- Effect: Better understanding
- Cause: Assume good intent
- Effect: Less conflict

**Personal Growth:**
- Cause: Read 10 pages/day
- Effect: 15 books/year
- Cause: Work out 3x/week
- Effect: Healthier body in 6 months

**The pattern**: Small, consistent causes → Large, compounded effects over time

## The Practice: Becoming Cause-Aware

### Week 1: Effect Recognition
**Goal**: Notice the effects in your life

**Daily practice:**
1. Pick one area: ranked, school, relationships
2. List 3 outcomes (effects) you experienced today
3. Ask: "What caused this?"
4. Write down the actual causes

**You'll discover**: Most "bad luck" has identifiable causes you can control

### Week 2: Cause Identification
**Goal**: Recognize what causes what

**Daily practice:**
1. Before each action, pause and ask: "What effect will this cause?"
2. After each outcome, ask: "What cause created this?"
3. Keep a cause-effect journal

**You'll discover**: You have way more agency than you thought

### Week 3: Cause Optimization
**Goal**: Deliberately create better causes

**Daily practice:**
1. Identify your #1 most common losing cause (tilt queue, no warm-up, tilted mental state, etc.)
2. Design replacement cause (5 min mental reset, 10 min warm-up game, etc.)
3. Track: Did changing the cause change the effect?

**You'll discover**: You can engineer better outcomes by engineering better causes

## Going Deeper: The Law of Consequences

### No Escaping Cause-Effect

You can ignore this principle, but you can't escape it.

**Every action you take (or don't take) creates consequences:**
- Practice daily → Get better (you can't avoid improving)
- Queue tilted repeatedly → Drop rank (you can't avoid consequences)
- Mute toxic players → Better mental (you can't avoid the benefit)

**This is liberating**: You're not at reality's mercy. You're co-creating it through your causes.

### The Compounding Nature

Effects compound over time:

**Year 1**: Small cause = Small effect
**Year 2**: Same cause repeated = Medium effect
**Year 5**: Same cause repeated = Massive effect

**Example: Daily practice**
- Day 1: Barely noticeable improvement
- Week 1: Slight improvement
- Month 1: Noticeable improvement
- Month 6: Different player
- Year 1: Different tier

**Most people quit at Day 1-7 because "it's not working."**
**Cause-Effect principle says: Keep creating the cause. The effect is guaranteed.**

### Karma is Cause-Effect

Different word, same principle:
- "Karma" = Your past causes creating present effects
- Good karma = Past good causes creating present good effects
- Bad karma = Past bad causes creating present bad effects

**You're not being punished or rewarded. You're experiencing the natural consequences of past causes.**

Want better karma? Start creating better causes today.

## Real-World Evidence

### Malcolm Gladwell's 10,000 Hours
**Cause**: Deliberate practice for 10,000 hours
**Effect**: Mastery in any field

Not magic. Cause-effect.

### Atomic Habits (James Clear)
**Cause**: 1% better each day
**Effect**: 37x better in one year (compounding)

Not motivation. Math.

### Professional Player Development
**Cause**: VOD review + practice + coaching + healthy lifestyle
**Effect**: Consistent high-level performance

Not talent. Process.

## Try It: The Cause-Effect Experiment

### This Week: Track Your Causes

**Pick ONE area to experiment:**
- Ranked games
- School/work
- Fitness
- Relationships

**Step 1**: Identify the effect you want
- Example: "I want to win 55% of ranked games this week"

**Step 2**: Identify the causes that create that effect
- Warm up 10 min before queue
- Only play my best 3 champions
- Mute at first toxicity
- Take 5 min break between games
- Stop after 2 losses in a row

**Step 3**: Create those causes consistently for 7 days

**Step 4**: Measure the effect
- Did you get closer to your desired outcome?
- Which causes had the biggest impact?

**Hypothesis**: If you control the causes, the effects will follow. Test it.

## What's Next?

You've learned the SIXTH principle: **Cause-Effect**.

**Key Insight**: You're not a victim of circumstances. You're the creator of causes that become your circumstances.

**The shift**: From "Why does this always happen to me?" to "What am I doing that causes this?"

**The power**: Once you see cause-effect chains clearly, you can engineer any outcome by engineering the right causes.
