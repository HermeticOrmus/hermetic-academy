# The Seven Hermetic Principles

> **TL;DR**: Seven universal laws that govern how reality works - from quantum physics to ranked games to your relationships. Master these, and you've unlocked the cheat codes for life.

---

## What This Is

The Seven Hermetic Principles are the core framework of Hermetic philosophy. They're not rules you follow - they're **laws describing how the universe operates**, like gravity or thermodynamics.

You can't break these laws. But you CAN work with them or against them.

**Working with them** = Flow, growth, success, leveling up
**Working against them** = Struggle, frustration, stuck, hardstuck

Think of it like playing a game:
- You can try to walk through walls (fighting the game's physics)
- OR you can learn the physics and use them to move efficiently

**These principles are the physics of reality itself.**

## Why This Matters (Gaming Edition)

You know how pro players seem to have "game sense" that silvers don't? They're not just mechanically better - they understand the **patterns** that govern the game.

**The 7 Hermetic Principles are the patterns that govern everything.**

Once you learn them, you start seeing:
- Why some strategies work and others don't
- Why you get stuck and how to get unstuck
- Why certain people succeed and others struggle
- Why your mindset determines your rank

It's like going from playing by feel to playing with **conscious mastery of the game's underlying systems**.

## The 7 Principles: Quick Reference

### 1. The Principle of Mentalism

**Ancient**: "THE ALL IS MIND; The Universe is Mental."

**Gaming Translation**: Your mental build determines your raid boss.

**Core Insight**: Reality is shaped by consciousness. Your thoughts, beliefs, and mental state create the world you experience. Change your mind, change your reality.

**Simple Example**:
- Go into ranked thinking "I'm gonna lose" → You play scared → You lose
- Go into ranked thinking "I'm here to learn" → You play adaptive → You improve

Same game. Different mental state. Different outcome.

### 2. The Principle of Correspondence

**Ancient**: "As above, so below; as below, so above."

**Gaming Translation**: Lane phase mirrors teamfight mirrors life strategy.

**Core Insight**: Patterns repeat across all levels of reality. What's true in one domain is often true in another. Master a pattern once, recognize it everywhere.

**Simple Example**:
- Lane phase resource management (CS, mana, HP)
- = Life resource management (money, energy, time)
- Same pattern, different scale

### 3. The Principle of Vibration

**Ancient**: "Nothing rests; everything moves; everything vibrates."

**Gaming Translation**: Everything moves, nothing is stuck.

**Core Insight**: Everything is in constant motion, including you. There's no "stuck" - only different frequencies of movement. When you feel stuck, you're just vibrating at a frequency that FEELS static.

**Simple Example**:
- Your rank isn't fixed - it's constantly fluctuating based on your play
- Your skill isn't static - it's always developing or decaying
- Your mood isn't permanent - it's a frequency that shifts

### 4. The Principle of Polarity

**Ancient**: "Everything is Dual; everything has poles; everything has its pair of opposites."

**Gaming Translation**: Aggro and defensive plays are two sides of the same coin (risk).

**Core Insight**: Opposites are actually identical in nature, just different in degree. Hot and cold are both temperature. Aggressive and passive are both approaches to pressure. Master both poles to access the full spectrum.

**Simple Example**:
- Losing = Learning in disguise
- Strength = Weakness taken too far
- Confidence = Fear transformed
- Same energy, different expression

### 5. The Principle of Rhythm

**Ancient**: "Everything flows, out and in; everything has its tides; all things rise and fall."

**Gaming Translation**: Push windows, farm mode, ranked seasons, meta shifts.

**Core Insight**: Everything moves in cycles. There's a time to push and a time to farm. A time to grind and a time to rest. Working WITH the rhythm = effortless. Working AGAINST it = exhausting.

**Simple Example**:
- You can't push 24/7 - eventually you need to reset
- You can't farm forever - eventually you need to fight
- You can't grind non-stop - eventually you need Day 7 rest
- Know the cycle, work the cycle

### 6. The Principle of Cause and Effect

**Ancient**: "Every Cause has its Effect; every Effect has its Cause; everything happens according to Law."

**Gaming Translation**: Your plays create your LP.

**Core Insight**: Nothing happens by chance. Every outcome is the result of specific causes. Control the causes, control the effects. Small causes compound into big effects over time.

**Simple Example**:
- Mute toxic player (cause) → Better mental (effect) → Better plays (effect) → More wins (effect)
- Over 100 games, that ONE decision = 10-20 extra wins
- Your rank isn't luck - it's accumulated causes and effects

### 7. The Principle of Gender

**Ancient**: "Gender is in everything; everything has its Masculine and Feminine Principles."

**Gaming Translation**: Tank + DPS both needed. Balance creates power.

**Core Insight**: Everything has both masculine (active, assertive, directional) and feminine (receptive, intuitive, connective) energies. Wholeness requires both. Imbalance in either direction creates problems.

**Simple Example**:
- **Too much masculine**: All mechanical execution, no strategy. Bot clicking buttons.
- **Too much feminine**: All theory, no practice. Analysis paralysis.
- **Balance**: Aggressive when needed (Yang), patient when needed (Yin). Flow between both.

## How They Work Together

These principles aren't separate - they're **aspects of the same underlying reality**.

Think of it like a game's systems:
- Each system has its own rules (damage, gold, XP, vision)
- But they all interact and influence each other
- Understanding ONE system helps, but understanding how they ALL connect = mastery

### Example: Climbing from Gold to Platinum

Let's see all 7 principles working together:

1. **Mentalism**: Change belief from "I'm hardstuck Gold" to "I'm learning patterns that will take me higher"
2. **Correspondence**: Recognize that micro-improvements in lane phase compound into macro advantages
3. **Vibration**: Understand your rank is always fluctuating - trust the upward trend over time
4. **Polarity**: Learn when to play aggressive (when ahead) vs defensive (when behind) - same risk stat, different expressions
5. **Rhythm**: Know when to push ranked (fresh, focused) vs when to take a break (tilted, tired)
6. **Cause-Effect**: Track which specific plays lead to wins - double down on those causes
7. **Gender**: Balance mechanical execution (masculine) with strategic thinking (feminine)

**Result**: You don't "try harder" to climb. You **work with universal principles** and climbing becomes natural.

## The Power of Principle-Based Thinking

### Before Learning Principles (Surface-Level)
- "I lost because my team was bad"
- "I'm stuck because I have bad luck"
- "I need to grind more hours"
- **Problem**: Random actions, no clear path forward

### After Learning Principles (Systems-Level)
- "I lost because I didn't respect the Rhythm principle - I played tilted" (Rhythm)
- "I'm stuck because my mental state creates scared plays" (Mentalism)
- "I need to work smarter, not just harder - focus on causes that create wins" (Cause-Effect)
- **Solution**: Targeted improvements, clear leverage points

**The difference**: You stop fighting symptoms and start addressing root causes.

## Common Mistakes

| ❌ Wrong | ✅ Right |
|----------|----------|
| "I need to master all 7 at once" | Start with 1-2, let understanding deepen naturally |
| "These are separate concepts" | They're interconnected aspects of one reality |
| "I need to memorize definitions" | You need to recognize them in action |
| "This is just theory" | Every principle has immediate practical application |
| "I'll learn this when I have time" | You're already using them unconsciously - might as well be conscious |

   - Personal projects
3. Practice consciously applying 2-3 principles daily

### Advanced Path (Month 2+)
**Goal**: Integrate principles into unconscious competence

1. Principles become your default way of seeing reality
2. You automatically recognize patterns across domains
3. You can teach others what you've learned
4. Your life reflects conscious mastery of these laws
