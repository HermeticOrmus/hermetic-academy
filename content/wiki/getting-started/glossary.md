## Core Hermetic Terms

### The All
**Definition**: The infinite, eternal, universal consciousness/intelligence that underlies all reality.

**Gaming translation**: The source code of the universe. The ultimate "server" everything runs on.

**Example**: Like how all League games run on Riot's servers, all reality "runs" on The All.

---

### The Seven Hermetic Principles
**Definition**: Seven universal laws that govern how reality operates.

**The list**:
1. Mentalism - The All is Mind
2. Correspondence - As Above, So Below
3. Vibration - Nothing Rests
4. Polarity - Everything is Dual
5. Rhythm - Everything Flows
6. Cause-Effect - Every Cause Has Its Effect
7. Gender - Masculine & Feminine in All Things

**Gaming translation**: The "game mechanics" of reality. Once you know these, you understand how everything works.

---

### Hermetics / Hermeticism
**Definition**: An ancient philosophical and spiritual tradition based on teachings attributed to Hermes Trismegistus. Focuses on understanding universal laws and mastering consciousness.

**Gaming translation**: Like learning the meta for reality itself. The framework for understanding how life actually works.

**Origin**: Ancient Egypt/Greece (~2000+ years ago), preserved through texts like The Kybalion.

---

### The Kybalion
**Definition**: A book published in 1908 that presents the Seven Hermetic Principles in accessible language.

**Why it matters**: The most widely-read modern introduction to Hermetic philosophy. This wiki is partially based on its teachings but translated for modern gamers.

---

### Hermes Trismegistus
**Definition**: "Hermes the Thrice-Great" - legendary sage considered the founder of Hermetic philosophy. Possibly a combination of Greek god Hermes and Egyptian god Thoth.

**Gaming translation**: The OG grandmaster. The original source of the teachings.

---

## Principle-Specific Terms

### Mentalism Terms

#### Mental Build
**Definition**: Your collection of thoughts, beliefs, and mental frameworks that shape your reality.

**Gaming translation**: Like your rune build or item build, but for your mind. Wrong build = lose. Right build = win.

**Example**: "I'm hardstuck" vs "I'm learning" are two different mental builds with different outcomes.

---

#### Mental Diff
**Definition**: When one player/team wins primarily due to superior mental state (confidence, focus, resilience) rather than mechanics.

**Gaming term**: Commonly used in League/Valorant to say "we won because of mental difference."

**Example**: Two equally skilled teams, one stays calm when behind (wins), other tilts (loses) = mental diff.

---

#### The Observer
**Definition**: The part of you that can watch your thoughts without being controlled by them.

**Gaming translation**: The part of you that can notice "I'm tilting" without becoming the tilt.

**Practice**: Meditation, mindfulness, self-awareness exercises.

---

### Vibration Terms

#### Frequency / Vibration
**Definition**: The rate at which something vibrates/oscillates. In consciousness: your energetic state or "vibe."

**Gaming translation**: Your current "state" - high frequency = flow state (7-10/10), low frequency = tilt (1-4/10).

**Practical**: "What's my frequency right now?" = "How am I feeling/performing on a 1-10 scale?"

---

#### High Vibration State
**Definition**: State of elevated consciousness - calm confidence, mental clarity, flow, peak performance.

**Signs**: Clear thinking, fast reactions, enjoying the game, learning from mistakes, resilient.

**How to raise**: Exercise, good sleep, positive focus, music, breathwork, gratitude.

---

#### Low Vibration State
**Definition**: State of contracted consciousness - tilt, apathy, brain fog, poor performance.

**Signs**: Slow thinking, sluggish reactions, hating the game, repeating mistakes, fragile.

**How to avoid**: Rest before burnout, track mental state, stop when frequency drops.

---

#### Entrainment
**Definition**: When two vibrating systems synchronize with each other.

**Gaming translation**: Why you "catch" your teammate's tilt or why being around high-performers raises your game.

**Example**: Tuning forks resonate together. People's mental states synchronize when they spend time together.

---

### Polarity Terms

#### Poles / Polarity
**Definition**: The two opposite ends of the same spectrum. Not separate things - same thing at different degrees.

**Gaming translation**: Aggressive/passive aren't opposites - they're two ends of the "risk management" spectrum.

**Example**: Hot and cold are both temperature. Confidence and fear are both activation energy.

---

#### Transmutation
**Definition**: The process of shifting energy from one pole to another (negative → positive) without suppressing it.

**Gaming translation**: Converting tilt energy into determination. Same intensity, different charge.

**How**: Recognize → Accept → Breathe → Reframe → Redirect.

---

#### The Middle Path
**Definition**: The balanced point between two poles. Neither extreme.

**Gaming translation**: Not always aggressive or always passive - balanced risk-taking.

**Note**: Sometimes extremes are correct (all-in when ahead, ultra-safe when one death loses game).

---

### Rhythm Terms

#### Rhythm / Cycle
**Definition**: The regular, recurring pattern of movement between two states.

**Gaming translation**: Push window → farm window → push window. Grind days → rest days → grind days.

**Example**: Seasons, tides, heartbeat, breathing - everything moves in cycles.

---

#### The Pendulum Swing
**Definition**: The law that says every swing in one direction creates an equal swing in the opposite direction.

**Gaming translation**: Grind hard for 5 days → need 2 days rest. The harder you push, the more rest you need.

**Formula**: Measure of swing right = measure of swing left.

---

#### Compensation
**Definition**: The natural balancing that occurs when rhythm is ignored. If you don't consciously create the downswing, it forces itself (burnout, tilt, injury).

**Gaming translation**: Don't take rest days → burnout forces you to stop anyway (but now you have no control).

**Solution**: Honor rhythm consciously = maintain control.

---

### Correspondence Terms

#### As Above, So Below
**Definition**: The full teaching: "As above, so below; as below, so above; as within, so without; as without, so within."

**Meaning**: Patterns at one scale mirror patterns at all other scales.

**Gaming translation**: Wave management (micro) uses same patterns as life management (macro).

---

#### Pattern Transfer / Pattern Recognition
**Definition**: The ability to recognize a pattern you've mastered in one domain and apply it to a different domain.

**Gaming translation**: Once you master trading windows in lane, you recognize opportunity windows everywhere (job interviews, relationships, business).

**The power**: Learn once, apply everywhere. 17x learning multiplier.

---

#### Fractal
**Definition**: A pattern that repeats at every scale of observation.

**Examples in nature**: Coastlines, trees, rivers, lungs, broccoli.

**In consciousness**: Your daily pattern becomes your weekly pattern becomes your life pattern.

---

### Cause-Effect Terms

#### Cause-Effect Chain
**Definition**: A sequence where each effect becomes the cause of the next effect.

**Gaming translation**: Missed CS (cause) → Lost gold (effect = cause) → Weaker power spike (effect = cause) → Lost fight (effect).

**Why track**: See which causes create which effects. Change causes = change effects.

---

#### First Cause / Root Cause
**Definition**: The original action that started a cause-effect chain.

**Gaming translation**: The REAL reason you lost. Not "my team fed" (symptom), but "I didn't track jungle early game" (root cause).

**Finding it**: Ask "Why?" 5 times. Keep going backward until you find the controllable action.

---

#### LP Diff / Mental Diff / CS Diff
**Definition**: The measurable difference in LP (rank points), mental state, or CS (farm) between players/outcomes.

**Used in**: Tracking cause-effect relationships. "When I sleep 8+ hours, average LP diff = +15 compared to <6 hours."

---

### Gender Terms

#### Masculine Energy (Yang)
**Definition**: Active, assertive, analytical, outward-focused, doing-oriented, penetrating energy.

**Gaming manifestation**: Mechanical execution, aggressive plays, decisive calls, forcing action.

**NOT about**: Biological sex, gender identity, or men vs women. It's an energy type everyone has.

---

#### Feminine Energy (Yin)
**Definition**: Receptive, intuitive, creative, inward-focused, being-oriented, containing energy.

**Gaming manifestation**: Reading patterns, patient setups, adaptive strategies, receiving information.

**NOT about**: Biological sex, gender identity, or men vs women. It's an energy type everyone has.

---

#### Integration / Sacred Marriage
**Definition**: The balanced state where both masculine and feminine energies are accessible and flow naturally based on context.

**Gaming translation**: The complete player who can be aggressive AND patient, mechanical AND intuitive, analytical AND creative.

**The goal**: Access both energies fluidly, use whichever the moment requires.

---

## Gaming-Specific Terms

### CS (Creep Score)
**Definition**: Number of minions/monsters killed. Primary source of gold in lane phase.

**Why it matters in Hermetics**: Used as metaphor for resource management (Correspondence principle).

---

### LP (League Points)
**Definition**: Ranked points in League of Legends. Gain LP for wins, lose LP for losses.

**Why it matters in Hermetics**: Used as measurable outcome for tracking cause-effect chains.

---

### Mental / Mental State
**Definition**: Your psychological/emotional state while playing. Includes confidence, focus, tilt, clarity.

**Scale**: 1-10 (1 = maximum tilt, 10 = peak flow state, 6+ = good enough to play ranked).

---

### Tilt
**Definition**: Emotional state where frustration/anger impairs decision-making and performance.

**Signs**: Making same mistake repeatedly, blaming teammates, autopilot play, continuing to queue when losing.

**Hermetic view**: Low vibration state (Vibration principle). Can be transmitted to Yang energy (Polarity principle).

---

### Flow State
**Definition**: Peak performance state where action feels effortless, time distorts, complete focus.

**Signs**: Everything clicks, reactions feel instant, reading enemies easily, playing "in the zone."

**Hermetic view**: High vibration state (8-10/10 frequency).

---

### Elo / MMR / Rank
**Definition**: Rating systems that represent skill level.
- **Elo**: Original chess rating system
- **MMR**: Matchmaking Rating (hidden rank)
- **Rank**: Visible rank (Iron, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, Master, Grandmaster, Challenger)

**Hermetic view**: Your rank reflects your current resonant frequency (Vibration) and cause-effect chains (Cause-Effect).

---

### Meta
**Definition**: "Most Effective Tactics Available" - the current optimal strategies, champions, builds in the game.

**Why it matters in Hermetics**: Meta shifts are rhythms (Rhythm principle). Adapting to meta requires reading patterns (Correspondence).

---

### Power Spike
**Definition**: Moment when a champion becomes significantly stronger (level 2, level 6, completed item).

**Hermetic translation**: Leverage timing (Correspondence principle). Build power → use leverage → extract value.

---
