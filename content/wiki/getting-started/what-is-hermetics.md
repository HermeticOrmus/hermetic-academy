# What is Hermetics?

> **TL;DR**: Hermetics is an ancient philosophical system that teaches how reality works through 7 universal principles. Think of it as the operating system for consciousness - once you understand it, you can "hack" your life in ways that feel like cheat codes.

## What This Is

Hermetics (also called Hermeticism) is a set of philosophical and spiritual teachings attributed to **Hermes Trismegistus** - a legendary figure combining the Greek god Hermes and the Egyptian god Thoth. The core teachings were written down in a text called **"The Kybalion"** in 1908, though the wisdom itself dates back thousands of years.

Here's the thing: **This isn't religion. This isn't mysticism. This is a framework for understanding how the universe operates.**

Think of it like this:
- Physics tells you how matter works
- Psychology tells you how minds work
- Hermetics tells you how **everything** works - the universal patterns that show up in physics, psychology, gaming, relationships, business, and your ranked climb

## Why This Matters (Gaming Edition)

You know how in League of Legends, once you understand wave management, you suddenly see it EVERYWHERE? You start noticing how every matchup, every jungle gank, every baron call is about wave states?

**That's what learning Hermetics is like - but for your entire life.**

You learn these 7 principles, and suddenly:

- **That mental diff you always talk about?** That's Mentalism (Principle #1)
- **Why lane phase mirrors teamfight mirrors life strategy?** That's Correspondence (Principle #2)
- **Why some days you're on fire and some days you int?** That's Vibration (Principle #3)
- **Why aggro and defensive plays are two sides of the same coin?** That's Polarity (Principle #4)
- **Why you need to know when to push and when to farm?** That's Rhythm (Principle #5)
- **Why your small plays compound into LP gains/losses?** That's Cause-Effect (Principle #6)
- **Why you need both mechanical execution AND strategic thinking?** That's Gender (Principle #7)

### The Power of Pattern Recognition

Great players don't just know their champion - they understand the **patterns** that apply to EVERY champion. They see the game differently.

Hermetics is the same thing, but for reality itself.

## The 7 Hermetic Principles (Quick Overview)

| # | Principle | Gaming Translation | Core Truth |
|---|-----------|-------------------|------------|
| 1 | **Mentalism** | Your mental build determines your raid boss | "The All is Mind" |
| 2 | **Correspondence** | Lane phase = Teamfight = Life strategy | "As Above, So Below" |
| 3 | **Vibration** | Everything moves, nothing is stuck | "Nothing rests; everything vibrates" |
| 4 | **Polarity** | Aggro and defensive are the same stat | "Everything is dual" |
| 5 | **Rhythm** | Push windows, farm mode, meta shifts | "Everything flows in cycles" |
| 6 | **Cause-Effect** | Your plays create your LP | "Every action has consequences" |
| 7 | **Gender** | Tank + DPS both needed | "Everything has masculine and feminine" |

We'll dive deep into each one in the [Principles section](/wiki/principles).

## How It Works

### The Operating System Metaphor

Imagine your computer runs on Windows, macOS, or Linux. That's the operating system (OS) - the foundation that makes everything else work.

**Hermetics is the OS of reality.**

- Your daily experiences = Applications running on the OS
- Your beliefs and thoughts = The code you're running
- The 7 principles = The core system architecture

When you understand the OS, you can:
- Debug problems faster (why am I stuck?)
- Optimize performance (how do I level up?)
- Build better programs (how do I create what I want?)

### Why "Ancient Wisdom"? Isn't This Outdated?

Here's the wild part: **these principles were discovered thousands of years ago, and they STILL apply to modern life**. Why?

Because they're not about the surface-level details. They're about the **underlying patterns** that never change:

- Ancient people: "How do I farm better crops?" (Rhythm principle)
- Modern people: "How do I climb ranked better?" (Rhythm principle - same pattern, different context)

The principles are **timeless** because they describe how reality itself operates, not how specific technologies or cultures work.

### The Gaming Advantage

Here's why gamers have an unfair advantage learning Hermetics:

**You already understand systems thinking.**

- You know power spikes = Rhythm
- You know item builds = Correspondence
- You know mental diff = Mentalism
- You know risk/reward = Cause-Effect

You just didn't know these were **universal patterns that apply outside the game**.

That's what we're teaching here: How to take the systems mastery you already have in gaming and apply it to level up your actual life.

## Common Mistakes

| ❌ Wrong | ✅ Right |
|----------|----------|
| "This is religion" | It's a philosophical framework, not a belief system |
| "This is magic/mysticism" | It's pattern recognition applied to reality |
| "I need to believe in this" | You just need to test it and see if it works |
| "This is for spiritual people" | It's for anyone who wants to understand how things work |
| "It's too complex" | It's actually simpler than learning a new champion |

### The Test

You don't need to "believe" in Hermetics. You just need to **test it**:

1. Learn one principle
2. Apply it to your ranked games this week
3. See if it helps you play better
4. If it works, you know it's real

That's it. Hermetics is **pragmatic** - it either helps you or it doesn't.

## What Makes This Wiki Different?

**Most Hermetic resources are:**
- Written in archaic language (thee, thou, metaphysical jargon)
- Aimed at middle-aged spiritual seekers
- Focused on abstract philosophy

**This wiki is:**
- Written in gaming-native language (LP, ranked, meta, etc.)
- Aimed at teens and gamers (11-25 years old)
- Focused on practical application (how to actually use this)

### Our Approach

1. **Respect your intelligence** - No dumbing down, no condescension
2. **Gaming as the bridge** - You already know these patterns, we're just naming them
3. **Practical first** - Every concept has a "try it today" exercise
4. **No gatekeeping** - All wisdom free, forever

## Next Level: Why This Works

### Pattern Mastery = Transfer Learning

In machine learning, there's a concept called "transfer learning" - when you learn something in one domain, you can transfer that knowledge to another domain.

**That's exactly what Hermetics teaches.**

You learn:
- How to recognize patterns (Correspondence)
- How to work with timing (Rhythm)
- How to make better decisions (Cause-Effect)
- How to balance opposing forces (Polarity)

These skills transfer to EVERY area of life:
- Gaming → Career (same patterns)
- Ranked climb → Skill development (same patterns)
- Team coordination → Relationships (same patterns)

### The Meta-Skill

Learning Hermetics is learning **how to learn**. Once you see these patterns, you start recognizing them everywhere, which means:

- You pick up new games faster (pattern recognition)
- You solve problems easier (systems thinking)
- You adapt to change better (understanding cycles)
- You make better long-term decisions (seeing consequences)

It's not magic. It's just **conscious pattern recognition instead of unconscious**.

## Try It: Your First Hermetic Exercise

**This week, do this:**

1. Pick ONE principle that sounds interesting (start with Mentalism or Cause-Effect - they're the easiest)
2. Read the full article on that principle
3. Before your next ranked session, think: "How does this principle show up in my games?"
4. Play 3 games while consciously noticing that principle at work
5. After your session, write down one insight you had

That's it. You just did Hermetics.
