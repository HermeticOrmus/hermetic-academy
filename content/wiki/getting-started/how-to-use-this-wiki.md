## Three Ways to Use This Wiki

### 1. The Beginner Path (Recommended Start)

**If you're brand new to Hermetics:**

```
Week 1: Foundation
├─ Read: What is Hermetics?
├─ Read: The Seven Principles (overview)
└─ Try: Pick ONE principle that resonates

Week 2-8: Deep Dive (One Principle Per Week)
├─ Week 2: Mentalism
├─ Week 3: Correspondence
├─ Week 4: Vibration
├─ Week 5: Polarity
├─ Week 6: Rhythm
├─ Week 7: Cause-Effect
└─ Week 8: Gender

Week 9: Integration
└─ Read: How to Climb Ranked Using Hermetics
    (Shows all 7 principles working together)
```

**Why this works:**
- One principle per week = time to internalize
- Weekly exercises build habits
- By Week 8, you understand all 7 principles
- Week 9 shows how they integrate

**Time investment**: 15-20 minutes reading + daily 5-min practice per week

### 2. The Problem-Solver Path (Just-in-Time)

**If you have a specific problem right now:**

```
Problem: "I'm hardstuck in ranked"
├─ Start: How to Climb Ranked Using Hermetics
├─ Deep dive: Cause-Effect (Your plays create your LP)
└─ Practice: Cause-Effect tracking for 2 weeks

Problem: "I tilt constantly"
├─ Start: Vibration (Shift your frequency)
├─ Also read: Rhythm (Rest before you tilt)
└─ Practice: Pre-game frequency check

Problem: "I feel stuck in life"
├─ Start: Mentalism (Change your mental build)
├─ Also read: Correspondence (Patterns repeat)
└─ Practice: Mental inventory exercise

Problem: "I burn out quickly"
├─ Start: Rhythm (Honor cycles)
├─ Also read: Gender (Balance doing + being)
└─ Practice: Weekly rhythm structure
```

**How to do this:**
1. Identify your current problem
2. Search wiki for relevant principle
3. Read that ONE article
4. Do the practice exercises
5. Return in 1-2 weeks for next problem

### 3. The Mastery Path (Complete Integration)

**If you want DEEP mastery over 3-6 months:**

```
Month 1: Foundation
├─ Read all "Getting Started" articles
├─ Read all 7 principle overviews
└─ Create your Pattern Library (write down patterns you see)

Month 2-3: Application
├─ Read all "Applications" articles
├─ Apply ONE principle deeply to your life each week
├─ Track results (what changed?)
└─ Integrate learnings

Month 4-6: Advanced Integration
├─ Combine multiple principles
├─ Create your own frameworks
├─ Teach others (best way to master)
└─ Build custom practices
```

**Result**: By Month 6, Hermetic thinking becomes automatic. You see patterns everywhere, recognize cycles, shift states on demand.

## How to Get the Most Value

### 1. Read Actively, Not Passively

**Don't just consume:**
- ❌ Read article → "That's interesting" → forget it

**Do engage:**
- ✅ Read article → Ask: "Where do I see this in MY life?"
- ✅ Take notes on examples that resonate
- ✅ Try ONE exercise from each article

**The difference**: Passive reading = information. Active engagement = transformation.

### 2. Practice the Weekly Exercises

**Every principle article has 3-week practice:**
- Week 1: Awareness (notice the pattern)
- Week 2: Application (practice consciously)
- Week 3: Integration (make it automatic)

**The temptation**: Skip exercises, just read theory

**The reality**: Exercises create actual change. Theory alone changes nothing.

**Commit**: Do at least Week 1 exercise for each principle you read.

### 3. Track Your Progress

**Simple tracking method:**

Create a note (digital or physical):
```
Hermetic Principles - My Journey

MENTALISM (Week of Jan 15)
- What I learned: My thoughts about "hardstuck" were creating hardstuck reality
- What I tried: Changed "I'm hardstuck" to "I'm learning patterns"
- What changed: Won 7 of 10 games this week (was 4/10 before)

CORRESPONDENCE (Week of Jan 22)
- What I learned: Trading in lane = same pattern as opportunity windows in life
- What I tried: Applied CS management to time management
- What changed: Got more done with less effort

...continue for each principle
```

**Why track:**
- You see your progress over time
- You remember what worked
- You build your personal Pattern Library
- You have proof that this works for YOU

### 4. Return Often

**This isn't one-and-done:**

You'll get different insights depending on your current situation:
- First read: "Oh, interesting concept"
- Second read (3 months later): "Wait, this applies to my current problem"
- Third read (1 year later): "Holy shit, I see patterns I didn't see before"

**The wiki grows with you.** Same articles, deeper understanding each time.

## Common Questions

### "Do I need to read in order?"

**Short answer**: No, but it helps.

**Longer answer**:
- **Beginner?** Read in order (Getting Started → Principles 1-7 → Applications)
- **Problem-solving?** Jump directly to relevant principle
- **Advanced?** Read whatever calls to you

**Mentalism is the foundation** - if you only read one, read that. The other 6 principles build on it.

### "How long does it take?"

**To read everything**: 15-20 hours total
- Getting Started: 1 hour
- All 7 Principles: 10-12 hours
- Applications + Guides: 5-8 hours

**To internalize everything**: 3-6 months of practice

**The math**:
- 7 principles × 3 weeks each = 21 weeks (~5 months)
- 15 min reading + 5 min daily practice = 20 min/day
- Total: 2,100 minutes = 35 hours spread over 5 months

**Reality**: Most people see results in 2-3 weeks (after internalizing just 1-2 principles)

### "Which principle should I start with?"

**If you want fastest results:**
- **Hardstuck in ranked?** Start: Cause-Effect
- **Mental game issues?** Start: Mentalism or Vibration
- **Burnout problems?** Start: Rhythm
- **Feel stuck in life?** Start: Mentalism

**If you want complete foundation:**
- Start with Mentalism (it's the foundation)
- Then read all 7 in order

### "Is this actually useful or just philosophy?"

**Test it:**

1. Read ONE principle article (15 min)
2. Do the Week 1 exercise (5 min/day for 7 days)
3. Track what changes

**If nothing changes**: This isn't for you, that's okay
**If something changes**: Keep going with other principles

**Philosophy becomes useful when you practice it.** Reading alone does nothing.

### "Can I apply this to non-gaming areas?"

**Absolutely.**

The gaming examples are just translations. The principles apply to:
- Career and business
- Relationships and social life
- Health and fitness
- Learning and skill development
- Creative work
- Spiritual growth
- ANY area of life

**Gaming is just the hook.** The wisdom is universal.
