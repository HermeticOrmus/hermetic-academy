# How to Climb Ranked Using Hermetic Principles

> **TL;DR**: Stop grinding mindlessly. Start applying the 7 Hermetic principles to ranked. Climb faster with less effort by working WITH universal laws instead of against them.

## The Problem with Traditional Ranked Advice

**What you've heard:**
- "Just play more games"
- "Watch pro VODs"
- "Get better mechanics"
- "One-trick a champion"

**Why it doesn't work alone:**

Because you're treating symptoms, not addressing root causes. You're trying to force results instead of understanding the principles that CREATE results.

**The Hermetic approach**: Understand HOW climbing works at a principle level. Then apply those principles systematically.

## The Hermetic Climbing Framework

### Phase 1: Mental Foundation (Mentalism)

**Principle**: "The All is Mind" - Your rank is a mental construct

**Before you queue this week, fix your mental build:**

**❌ Losing Mental Build:**
- "I'm hardstuck [rank]"
- "My teammates are always bad"
- "I need to get lucky"
- "I'm not good enough"

**✅ Winning Mental Build:**
- "I'm learning patterns that will take me higher"
- "I focus on what I control"
- "I create my own luck through smart causes"
- "I improve 1% each game"

**Action Steps:**
1. Before every session, spend 30 seconds setting intention: "I'm here to learn and improve, regardless of wins/losses"
2. After every loss, identify ONE lesson learned (not blame teammates)
3. After every win, identify ONE thing you did well to repeat

**Expected Result**: You'll play 20-30% better in same games just from mental state change.

---

### Phase 2: Pattern Recognition (Correspondence)

**Principle**: "As Above, So Below" - Patterns repeat across scales

**Learn to see the pattern once, recognize it everywhere:**

**The Pattern: Resource Management**

In lane phase:
- HP = resource
- Mana = resource
- CS = resource
- Waves = resource

In life:
- Energy = resource
- Time = resource
- Money = resource
- Attention = resource

**The pattern is identical. Master resource management in lane → You've mastered it everywhere.**

**Key Patterns to Learn:**

| Pattern | Lane Phase | Teamfights | Climbing | Life |
|---------|------------|------------|----------|------|
| **Tempo** | Wave control | Engage timing | When to queue | When to push projects |
| **Economy** | CS/Gold | Item spike | Champion mastery investment | Skill development |
| **Pressure** | Trading stance | Threat range | Queue dodge decisions | Opportunity recognition |
| **Vision** | Ward placement | Enemy positioning | VOD review | Self-awareness |

**Action Steps:**
1. This week, pick ONE pattern (start with Tempo or Economy)
2. Study how it works in lane phase
3. Notice how same pattern appears in teamfights
4. Notice how same pattern appears in your climb strategy
5. Master the pattern once = Master it everywhere

**Expected Result**: You'll make better decisions automatically because you recognize patterns faster.

### Phase 3: Momentum Management (Vibration)

**Principle**: "Nothing Rests" - Everything is frequency and momentum

**Your rank is always vibrating between win streaks and loss streaks. Learn to work with momentum:**

**High Frequency States (Play More):**
- Just won 2+ games
- Feeling focused and energized
- Making good reads consistently
- Team coordination flowing

**→ Action**: Keep playing, ride the momentum

**Low Frequency States (Stop Playing):**
- Just lost 2+ games
- Feeling tilted or scattered
- Making unforced errors
- Team coordination non-existent

**→ Action**: Take break, reset frequency

**Action Steps:**
1. After every game, rate your mental state 1-10
2. 7+ = Queue again
3. 6 or below = Take 5 min break
4. 4 or below = Stop for the day

**Expected Result**: You'll play 60%+ of your games in high frequency states, naturally climbing faster.

---

### Phase 4: Balanced Play (Polarity)

**Principle**: "Everything is Dual" - Opposites are the same energy at different degrees

**Stop seeing aggressive vs passive as opposites. They're the same risk management strategy expressed differently:**

**The Spectrum of Risk:**

```
Ultra Passive ←----------→ Ultra Aggressive
     |            |             |
   Scared      Balanced      Reckless
   (Too safe)  (Optimal)    (Too risky)
```

**Great players flow on this spectrum depending on context:**

- **Behind?** → Move toward defensive (minimize losses)
- **Even?** → Stay balanced (calculated trades)
- **Ahead?** → Move toward aggressive (maximize lead)

**The mistake**: Most players get stuck at one point on the spectrum:
- Passive players stay passive even when ahead (throw leads)
- Aggressive players stay aggressive even when behind (int harder)

**Action Steps:**
1. Before each game, identify your default (are you naturally passive or aggressive?)
2. During game, consciously practice the OPPOSITE of your default in appropriate situations
3. If you're passive → Force one aggressive play when ahead
4. If you're aggressive → Force one defensive play when behind

**Expected Result**: You'll become unpredictable and adaptive instead of one-dimensional.

### Phase 5: Timing & Cycles (Rhythm)

**Principle**: "Everything Flows" - There are push windows and farm windows

**Stop forcing plays 24/7. Learn when to push and when to farm:**

**Push Windows (Go for Objectives/Kills):**
- Enemy jungle camps are down
- Enemy used summoners
- Your team has item/level spikes
- Wave is pushing toward you
- You're on win streak (high momentum)

**Farm Windows (Scale/Reset):**
- Enemy jungle is up
- Enemy has all cooldowns
- Your team needs items
- Wave is frozen
- You're on loss streak (low momentum)

**The Meta-Rhythm: Your Weekly Grind**

**Don't grind 7 days/week. You need rhythm:**

| Day | Type | Focus |
|-----|------|-------|
| Mon-Wed | Grind Days | Play ranked, practice |
| Thu | Analysis Day | VOD review, identify patterns |
| Fri-Sat | Peak Days | Your best mental state, peak performance |
| Sun | Rest Day | No ranked, reset mental |

**Action Steps:**
1. Track when you play your best (time of day, day of week)
2. Schedule ranked during YOUR peak windows
3. Avoid ranked during low-energy windows (after school/work when tired)
4. Take mandatory Day 7 rest

**Expected Result**: You'll climb faster playing 4-5 days well than 7 days poorly.

### Phase 6: Cause-Effect Tracking (Cause-Effect)

**Principle**: "Every Cause has its Effect" - Your plays create your LP

**Stop saying "I'm unlucky." Start tracking causes and effects:**

**The Winning Causes Spreadsheet:**

| Cause (What I Did) | Effect (What Happened) | Win/Loss | Notes |
|-------------------|------------------------|----------|-------|
| Muted toxic teammate | Stayed focused | Win | Worth 10-20 extra wins/100 games |
| Warmed up 10 min | Better mechanics | Win | First game performance +20% |
| Played tired | Slow reactions | Loss | Never queue after 10pm |
| Played off-role | Fed | Loss | Stick to main role |

**Action Steps:**
1. After every 10 games, identify your top 3 winning causes
2. Identify your top 3 losing causes
3. Next 10 games: Do MORE of winning causes, LESS of losing causes
4. Repeat cycle

**Expected Result**: Your win rate will increase 5-10% from cause optimization alone.

### Phase 7: Balance Execution & Strategy (Gender)

**Principle**: "Gender in Everything" - You need both mechanical (Yang) and strategic (Yin) mastery

**Most players over-develop one and under-develop the other:**

**All Mechanics, No Brain (Pure Yang):**
- Great combos, terrible macro
- Win lane, lose game
- High mechanics, low rank

**All Brain, No Hands (Pure Yin):**
- Great theory, can't execute
- Know what to do, can't do it
- Analysis paralysis

**The Balance:**

| Yang (Masculine) | Practice | Yin (Feminine) | Practice |
|------------------|----------|-----------------|----------|
| Mechanical execution | 30 min practice tool | Strategic thinking | 30 min VOD review |
| Aggressive plays | Force 3 risky plays/game | Patient setups | Wait for perfect opportunities |
| Fast decisions | No hesitation | Calculated decisions | Think 3 moves ahead |

**Action Steps:**
1. Identify which you over-rely on (mechanics or strategy)
2. This week, spend 50% time on your WEAK side
3. Too mechanical? Watch 3 pro games focusing on macro decisions
4. Too strategic? Spend 30 min in practice tool every day

**Expected Result**: You'll become a complete player - brain AND hands working together.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake #1: "I'll just learn all 7 at once"

**Wrong**: Information overload, nothing sticks

**Right**: Start with 2-3 principles (Mentalism, Cause-Effect, Rhythm are most beginner-friendly), master those, then add more

### Mistake #2: "I'll apply this when I have time"

**Wrong**: Your current approach creates current results. Want different results? Start today.

**Right**: Pick ONE principle, apply it to your next 5 games, see immediate improvement

### Mistake #3: "This is too complex"

**Wrong thinking**: These principles are simpler than learning a new champion

**Right thinking**: You already USE these principles unconsciously. We're just making you conscious of them.
