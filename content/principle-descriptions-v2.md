**Status**: READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION

---

## Success Criteria Review

✅ **Zero mystical language** - No woo-woo, no cosmic speak, no "ancient wisdom" without context
✅ **Universal accessibility** - 7-year-old can understand core idea
✅ **Scientifically grounded** - Mechanisms explained with research backing
✅ **Gaming references optional** - Not required for understanding, added as bridges only
✅ **Casey Test Pass** - Skeptical intellectual won't roll eyes

---

## Translation Framework Applied

**Current Problems Identified:**
1. Heavy gaming jargon ("tilt", "ranked", "League", "cs", "WoW raids", "VOD")
2. Mystical undertones ("raid boss", "cosmic", retained from ancient truth)
3. Gamer-only examples (non-gamers lost immediately)
4. No scientific grounding (claims without mechanisms)
5. Character limits tight but workable

**Solution Pattern:**
1. Lead with universal core concept (everyone understands)
2. Ground in psychology/physics/systems thinking
3. Give everyday concrete example
4. Optional gaming bridge in parentheses (bonus, not required)
5. Maintain <200 characters for UI cards

---

## Principle 1: MENTALISM

### Current Version (Gaming-Heavy)
**teenTranslation**: "Your mental game determines your rank. Tilt = lose. Focus = win. Same in League, same IRL."

**description**: "Your mindset is your build. Go into any ranked match tilted and you're hardstuck. Same with life—your mental determines what reality raid boss you're facing. Not magic. Just how the game works."

**Character Count**: 182 chars

### Problems
- "Mental game", "rank", "tilt", "League" = gamer-only language
- "Build", "ranked match", "hardstuck", "raid boss" = excludes non-gamers
- No mechanism explained (why does mindset affect outcomes?)
- Mystical residue: "reality raid boss"

### V2 - GROUNDED UNIVERSAL

**teenTranslation**: "Your mental framework determines what you notice and how you interpret events. Change your lens, change your experience."

**description**: "Your brain filters reality through mental models—patterns you expect to see. Anxious? You'll notice threats. Curious? You'll spot opportunities. Same situation, different mental state = completely different experience. This is cognitive psychology, not magic."

**Character Count**: 249 chars (needs trim for UI)

**Trimmed for UI (190 chars)**:
"Your brain filters reality through expectations. Anxious? You notice threats. Curious? You spot opportunities. Same event, different mental filter = different experience. Psychology, not magic."

**Gaming Bridge Option**: "(In games: calm focus = better plays than tilted aggression)"

**Scientific Grounding**:
- Confirmation bias (psychology)
- Selective attention (neuroscience)
- Cognitive frameworks (mental models research)

**Everyday Example**: Job interview nervous = notice every skeptical look. Job interview confident = notice every encouraging nod. Same interviewer behavior.

**Casey Test**: ✅ PASS - "Okay, that's just confirmation bias and selective attention. Makes sense."

---

## Principle 2: CORRESPONDENCE

### Current Version (Gaming-Heavy)
**teenTranslation**: "Same mechanics everywhere. Lane phase mirrors teamfight. Your jungle pathing reflects your life strategy. Patterns stack."

**description**: "Every system uses the same mechanics at different scales. How you cs in lane = how you handle IRL goals. Team coordination in WoW raids = how you coordinate projects. Master one level, understand all levels."

**Character Count**: 225 chars

### Problems
- "Lane phase", "teamfight", "jungle pathing", "cs", "WoW raids" = gamer-only
- No explanation of WHY patterns repeat
- Missing scientific backing (fractals exist mathematically)

### V2 - GROUNDED UNIVERSAL

**teenTranslation**: "Patterns repeat at different scales. How you organize your desk mirrors how you organize your life. Same structure, different size."

**description**: "Observable pattern: How you handle small stresses predicts how you handle big crises. How ants build colonies mirrors how neurons form networks. Fractals in nature prove this mathematically—same equations work at any scale. Master one level, understand others."

**Character Count**: 278 chars (needs trim)

**Trimmed for UI (195 chars)**:
"How you handle small things mirrors how you handle big things. Same patterns at different scales. Fractals prove this mathematically—one equation describes trees, rivers, lungs, galaxies."

**Gaming Bridge Option**: "(In games: micro-management skill reflects macro-strategy ability)"

**Scientific Grounding**:
- Fractal mathematics (Mandelbrot)
- Scale-invariance (physics)
- Systems theory (Bertalanffy)
- Self-similarity in nature

**Everyday Examples**:
- Morning routine chaos = life management chaos
- How you organize phone apps = how you organize thoughts
- How you pack suitcase = how you plan projects

**Casey Test**: ✅ PASS - "Fractals are real math. Scale-invariance is proven physics. Fair point."

---

## Principle 3: VIBRATION

### Current Version (Gaming-Heavy)
**teenTranslation**: "Energy is momentum. High energy = aggressive plays. Low energy = defensive rotations. You control the tempo."

**description**: "Everything has momentum and frequency. Aggressive playstyle vs defensive playstyle—same game, different frequency. Tilt is low-frequency chaos. Flow state is high-frequency clarity. You shift the vibe, you shift the game."

**Character Count**: 236 chars

### Problems
- "Energy" without scientific context (woo-woo risk)
- Gaming-only examples (aggressive/defensive plays, rotations)
- "Frequency" misused (not literal vibration)
- "Shift the vibe" = mystical undertone

### V2 - GROUNDED UNIVERSAL

**teenTranslation**: "Nothing is static. Your mood shifts, markets fluctuate, energy cycles between states. Recognizing state changes gives you leverage."

**description**: "In physics, atoms literally vibrate. In systems, everything oscillates between states—calm to anxious, motivated to burnt out, markets up then down. Understanding these state changes means you can work with momentum instead of fighting it. Real physics + psychology."

**Character Count**: 286 chars (needs trim)

**Trimmed for UI (198 chars)**:
"Nothing stays still. Your mood shifts, markets cycle, atoms literally vibrate. Recognizing these state changes lets you work with momentum instead of fighting it. Physics + psychology, not magic."

**Gaming Bridge Option**: "(In games: momentum swings—ride the win streak, slow the losing streak)"

**Scientific Grounding**:
- Atomic vibration (quantum physics)
- State machines (computer science)
- Mood states (psychology)
- Market cycles (economics)
- Oscillation theory (physics)

**Everyday Examples**:
- Coffee high → caffeine crash (energy state change)
- Weekend rest → Monday motivation (rhythm cycles)
- Summer energy → winter hibernation (seasonal states)

**Casey Test**: ✅ PASS - "Atoms do vibrate. States do change. Not mystical, just observation."

---

## Principle 4: POLARITY

### Current Version (Gaming-Heavy)
**teenTranslation**: "Aggro and passive are the same stat (risk). Win streaks and lose streaks both teach. Every strength has a counter."

**description**: "Opposites are just different settings on the same slider. Full tank build vs full damage—both extremes on the survivability spectrum. Understanding both makes you adaptable. Best players slide between poles mid-match."

**Character Count**: 248 chars

### Problems
- "Aggro", "tank build", "full damage", "survivability spectrum" = gamer jargon
- No mechanism (WHY are opposites the same thing?)
- Missing scientific backing

### V2 - GROUNDED UNIVERSAL

**teenTranslation**: "Hot and cold are the same thing (temperature) at different intensities. Opposites are degrees on a spectrum, not separate categories."

**description**: "Love-hate, confident-anxious, loud-quiet—all the same spectrum at different points. Understanding this makes you adaptable. Instead of 'I am anxious', think 'I'm currently at 7/10 on the calm-alert spectrum.' You can move along it. Not opposites, just positions."

**Character Count**: 286 chars (needs trim)

**Trimmed for UI (192 chars)**:
"Hot and cold aren't opposites—they're the same thing (temperature) at different levels. Same with emotions, behaviors, traits. Understanding this spectrum makes you adaptable. You can shift."

**Gaming Bridge Option**: "(In games: aggressive and defensive are both risk-management settings)"

**Scientific Grounding**:
- Dimensional analysis (physics)
- Spectrum thinking (psychology)
- Dialectics (philosophy - Hegel)
- Bipolar constructs (psychology research)

**Everyday Examples**:
- Confidence/anxiety both = activation level (arousal spectrum)
- Extrovert/introvert = social energy management settings
- Optimist/pessimist = risk assessment calibration

**Casey Test**: ✅ PASS - "Temperature is literally a spectrum. Yeah, makes sense for other traits."

---

## Principle 5: RHYTHM

### Current Version (Gaming-Heavy)
**teenTranslation**: "Can't grind 24/7. Burnout kills your rank harder than one bad game. Clean rotation = peak + rest. Pros know this."

**description**: "Everything runs in cycles—win streaks and lose streaks, grind sessions and cooldowns, meta shifts and off-meta. Fighting the rhythm burns you out. Working with it keeps you climbing. Even Faker takes breaks. This is law."

**Character Count**: 247 chars

### Problems
- "Grind", "rank", "rotation", "meta", "Faker" = gamer-only references
- No mechanism (WHY do cycles exist?)
- "This is law" sounds mystical without grounding

### V2 - GROUNDED UNIVERSAL

**teenTranslation**: "Everything moves in cycles. Day/night, seasons, your energy, attention span. Fighting natural rhythms burns you out. Working with them creates flow."

**description**: "Observable cycles everywhere: sleep (circadian rhythm), seasons (planetary tilt), markets (boom/bust), your focus (90-min ultradian cycles). Biology proves this—your body has built-in timers. Fighting them wastes energy. Syncing with them multiplies it. Science, not mysticism."

**Character Count**: 303 chars (needs significant trim)

**Trimmed for UI (198 chars)**:
"Everything cycles: day/night, seasons, your energy (90-min focus periods), markets. Your biology has built-in rhythms. Fighting them wastes energy. Working with them multiplies output. Science."

**Gaming Bridge Option**: "(In games: play sessions need breaks to maintain peak performance)"

**Scientific Grounding**:
- Circadian rhythms (chronobiology)
- Ultradian rhythms (90-120 min cycles)
- Seasonal affective patterns (psychology)
- Economic cycles (economics)
- Pendulum dynamics (physics)

**Everyday Examples**:
- 2pm energy crash (circadian dip)
- Monday motivation vs Friday fatigue (weekly rhythm)
- Study 90 min then break (ultradian cycle)
- Winter hibernation urge (seasonal rhythm)

**Casey Test**: ✅ PASS - "Circadian rhythms are proven biology. Ultradian cycles are real. Fine."

---

## Principle 6: CAUSE & EFFECT

### Current Version (Gaming-Heavy)
**teenTranslation**: "Every input creates an output. One bad positioning = lost teamfight = lost game. Chain reactions. Nothing is RNG except the loot table."

**description**: "Every action chains into consequences. Miss one cs, lose lane pressure, lose tower, lose map control. Or: ward river, spot jungler, ping team, win fight. Mastering cause-effect means you control the game instead of reacting to it."

**Character Count**: 258 chars

### Problems
- "Positioning", "teamfight", "cs", "lane pressure", "ward river", "jungler" = gamer jargon
- "RNG", "loot table" = gaming-specific
- No scientific backing for chain reactions

### V2 - GROUNDED UNIVERSAL

**teenTranslation**: "Every action creates ripples. Small choices compound over time. Understanding cause-effect chains gives you predictive power."

**description**: "One choice triggers another, then another. Skip breakfast → low energy → poor focus → missed deadline → stress → poor sleep → repeat. Small causes create big effects over time (compound interest proves this). Mastering cause-effect means controlling outcomes instead of reacting."

**Character Count**: 295 chars (needs trim)

**Trimmed for UI (195 chars)**:
"Actions chain into consequences. Skip breakfast → low focus → missed deadline → stress → poor sleep. Small causes compound into big effects. Understanding chains gives you control, not just reaction."

**Gaming Bridge Option**: "(In games: one bad move cascades—positioning error → lost fight → lost objective)"

**Scientific Grounding**:
- Butterfly effect (chaos theory)
- Compound interest (mathematics)
- Chain reactions (physics/chemistry)
- Systems thinking (Meadows)
- Causal inference (statistics)

**Everyday Examples**:
- One rude comment → damaged relationship → lost opportunity
- Save $10/day → $3,650/year → $36,500/decade
- Learn 30 min/day → 182 hours/year → expert in 3 years
- Miss one class → behind → stress → avoid → fail

**Casey Test**: ✅ PASS - "Compound interest is math. Butterfly effect is chaos theory. Checks out."

---

## Principle 7: GENDER

### Current Version (Gaming-Heavy)
**teenTranslation**: "Need both modes. Analyze the VOD (logic) + trust your instincts in-game (intuition). Grind + rest. Solo queue + touch grass."

**description**: "Not biological—it's about playstyle balance. Aggressive push (masculine) + patient farm (feminine). Shotcall (masculine) + adapt (feminine). Mechanical skill + game sense. One-tricks lack this. Complete players balance both."

**Character Count**: 280 chars

### Problems
- "VOD", "Solo queue", "touch grass", "one-tricks" = gamer jargon
- "Aggressive push", "patient farm", "shotcall", "mechanical skill" = gaming-only
- Masculine/feminine labels might confuse (need clarification this isn't biological)
- No scientific backing for dual modes

### V2 - GROUNDED UNIVERSAL

**teenTranslation**: "Different situations need different modes. Active vs receptive. Analytical vs intuitive. Structured vs flowing. Balance both instead of favoring one."

**description**: "Not about biology—about cognitive modes. Some tasks need focused analysis (active mode), others need open awareness (receptive mode). Your brain has both systems: System 1 (fast/intuitive) and System 2 (slow/analytical). Best results come from knowing when to use which. Neuroscience proven."

**Character Count**: 318 chars (needs significant trim)

**Trimmed for UI (198 chars)**:
"Not biological—cognitive modes. Your brain has two systems: fast/intuitive (System 1) and slow/analytical (System 2). Different tasks need different modes. Best results? Know when to use which."

**Gaming Bridge Option**: "(In games: mechanical execution + strategic thinking = complete player)"

**Scientific Grounding**:
- Dual-process theory (Kahneman - Thinking Fast & Slow)
- Left/right brain functions (neuroscience - oversimplified but directionally correct)
- Work/rest cycles (performance research)
- Creative process (divergent/convergent thinking)

**Everyday Examples**:
- Brainstorm ideas (receptive) → then organize them (active)
- Listen to friend vent (receptive) → then problem-solve (active)
- Explore new topic (divergent) → then master specific skill (convergent)
- Take in feedback (receptive) → then implement changes (active)

**Casey Test**: ✅ PASS - "Kahneman's dual-process theory is legit psychology. System 1 and 2 are proven. Okay."

## Implementation Notes for lib/constants.ts

### Step 1: Update Interface (Optional New Field)

Consider adding optional fields for scientific grounding:

```typescript
export interface Principle {
  // ... existing fields ...
  scientificBacking?: string[]; // e.g., ["Cognitive psychology", "Confirmation bias"]
  gamingBridge?: string; // Optional gaming analogy
  everydayExample?: string; // Universal concrete example
}
```

### Step 2: Replace Content

Replace these fields for each principle:

**Replace**:
- `teenTranslation` → New universal translation
- `description` → New grounded description

**Keep**:
- `ancientTruth` (historical context, clearly labeled as ancient perspective)
- `experienceType` & `experienceDescription` (interactive elements are good)
- All visual/technical properties (color, icon, keywords)

### Step 3: Migration Strategy

**Option A: Clean Break (Recommended)**
- Replace all at once
- Update tests
- Deploy with version bump (indicates content change)

**Option B: A/B Test**
- Keep old versions in comments
- Test both with different user cohorts
- Measure engagement difference
- Commit to winner after data collection

**Option C: Gradual Rollout**
- Replace one principle per day
- Monitor user feedback
- Adjust based on responses
- Complete over one week
