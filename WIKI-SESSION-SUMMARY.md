# Hermetic Academy - Wiki Foundation Session Summary

**Date**: 2025-11-10
**Session Focus**: Strategic pivot from interactive-first to wiki-first validation approach
**Status**: ✅ Foundation Complete, Ready for Next Phase

---

## 🎯 What Changed: The Strategic Pivot

### Before This Session
- **Approach**: Interactive experiences built FIRST
- **Status**: 7 interactive experiences complete (2,500+ lines of code)
- **Problem**: No validation if people actually want this before expensive feature investment

### After This Session
- **Approach**: Comprehensive wiki built FIRST (validation layer)
- **Status**: Wiki architecture designed, 5 foundational articles written
- **Benefit**: Validate demand fast and cheaply before building more complex features

### The Insight (From Ormus)
> "I feel that a knowledge base is the first way to really send this product out. Building interactive experiences is cool yet it's likely better to do that later down the line when the product has been validated as people wanting it."

**Result**: Complete strategic repositioning toward wiki-first approach.
